# Dockerised EndtoEnd_Machine-Learning-projet using Flasgger and Streamlit

## Tools used : `python`, `Flask`, `Docker`, `Streamlit`.

#### Description:

- Developed a Machine learning model to predict the Bank Note Authentication(i.e., whether the currency note is Original or Fake).
- Took the dataset file in .csv from `Kaggle` and created a [classifier](https://github.com/raghu826/EndtoEnd_Machine-Learning-projet/blob/master/Model.ipynb) using Logistic Regresesor from sklearn python library.
- After imported the classifier into [pickle file](https://github.com/raghu826/EndtoEnd_Machine-Learning-projet/blob/master/model.pkl).
- Next step is to create a flask API to make it more visualize using `Flasgger(Flasgger is used to create extraordinary UI)`.
- For the testing purpose of the API, postman is used.
- Dockerised the entire project.
- Then, to take it next level [Streamlit](https://github.com/raghu826/EndtoEnd_Machine-Learning-projet/blob/master/Streamlit.JPG) comes into picture.
- Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create and share beautiful, custom web apps for machine learning and data science. In just a few minutes you can build and deploy powerful data apps
